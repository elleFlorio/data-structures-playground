# Data Structures Playground
This is a simple project to better understand data structures by implementing them.
I really understand something only when I build it. :wink:

Right now the following data structures have been implemented:
* [Stack](src/main/java/com/elleflorio/dsp/stack/)
* [Queue](src/main/java/com/elleflorio/dsp/queue/)
* [Hashtable](src/main/java/com/elleflorio/dsp/hashtable/)
* [Tree](src/main/java/com/elleflorio/dsp/tree/)

Enjoy! :rocket:
